# Lab_1 GitHub setup

Why use GitHub?

Github is like Facebook for programmers. Everyone’s on there. You can look at what they’re working on and easily peruse their code and make suggestions or changes.

Github lowers the barriers to collaboration. It’s easy to offer suggested changes to others’ code through Github. It helps manage, collaborate, and share your work. We hope this course will help you get more familiar with Github which is a helpful skill in the long run.
