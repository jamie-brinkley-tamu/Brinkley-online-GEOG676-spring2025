    2. Watch the lab 3 instruction video.

To Hand In:

    1. Link to your GitHub page that contains the Python code
    2. Add a screenshot to your GitHub of the executed code

Additional notes:

    1. I noticed that a lot of students have got an error during lab 3 2. It is just because you are using "_"(single underscore) in front of and after the "init", the solution is quite simple: you should use "__"(double underscore) instead. This is a very tricky point for Python that is hard to detect.
